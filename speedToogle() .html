    <div class="b">Aditya L1 shall be the first space based Indian mission to study the Sun. The spacecraft shall be
        placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system, which is about 1.5 million km
        from the Earth. A satellite placed in the halo orbit around the L1 point has the major advantage of continuously
        viewing the Sun without any occultation/eclipses. This will provide a greater advantage of observing the solar
        activities and its effect on space weather in real time. The spacecraft carries seven payloads to observe the
        photosphere, chromosphere and the outermost layers of the Sun (the corona) using electromagnetic and particle
        and magnetic field detectors. Using the special vantage point L1, four payloads directly view the Sun and the
        remaining three payloads carry out in-situ studies of particles and fields at the Lagrange point L1, thus
        providing important scientific studies of the propagatory effect of solar dynamics in the interplanetary medium

        The suits of Aditya L1 payloads are expected to provide most crucial informations to understand the problem of
        coronal heating, coronal mass ejection, pre-flare and flare activities and their characteristics, dynamics of
        space weather, propagation of particle and fields etc.</div>
