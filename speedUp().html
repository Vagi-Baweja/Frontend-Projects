    <div class="b">Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with
        an objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander
        will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out
        in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover have
        scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry the LM
        from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM. Apart
        from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post
        separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the
        integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.</div>
